[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/std66/TomiSoft.YoutubeDownloader.WebUI?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

A simple WebUI for youtube-dl.

Requirements
------------
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
  - Microsoft .NET 6.0
  - IIS 8.0 or newer with WebSockets enabled

Run in Docker
-------------
The easiest way to get started is to use my Docker image. It is preconfigured and it is immediately ready to use.
https://hub.docker.com/r/std66/tomisoft-youtubedownloader-webui

```
docker run -d -p 28465:80 -p 30000:9000 std66/tomisoft-youtubedownloader-webui
```
Open http://localhost:28465 for the application. Prometheus metrics are available at http://localhost:30000/metrics

Running in Kubernetes
---------------------
It will be available in the future. Since the application is heavily stateful, it needs some more refactoring work to be done to fully utilitize the benefits of Kubernetes.

Features available at the moment:
- Can run in Kubernetes with 1 pod
- Can be configured using Kubernetes ConfigMap
